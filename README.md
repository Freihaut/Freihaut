#### Welcome to my GitHub Profile :blush:

Here you mostly find the apps, data and data analysis of my research projects. I mostly worked with React.js (and Electron.js in later projects) to create research software and analyzed the data with Python (and a little bit of R). Feel free to contact me with questions or feedback regarding my code or research at any time.
